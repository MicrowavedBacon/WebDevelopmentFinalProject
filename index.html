        <h2>What is Tidalbridge?</h2>

        <p>Tidalbridge started out as three musicians with a shared desire to encourage artistic growth in their local music scene.  Being largely a retirement community, Coos Bay was a relatively old-fashioned town with limited gigging opportunities.  While there wasn't an easy way to open up venue options, we found that we could just as easily help bands expose their music to new listeneres through video sessions and professional social media promoting.  Not only do these videos serve as an excellent addition to any band's professional portfolio, but they also act as a way to engage people in the exciting energy that comes with a live performance.</p>

        <p>With the leadership of audio engineer Gary Lebrun and video director Levi McElrath, the team came together and recorded our first session on November 6th, 2016 with local rock legends, Crushingcrayons.  In the following two years, we have managed to extend our reach to bands as far as New York, and the influence our platform offers to both new and existing clients continues to grow every day.</p>
