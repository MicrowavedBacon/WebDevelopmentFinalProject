      <h3>Levi McElrath | Video Director</h3>
      <p>Our lead video director has been shooting his own music videos and short films since his highschool years, and this has come to an ultimate peak in his work with Tidalbridge.  He works with professional-grade equipment and a simple-yet-stylish visual style that allows each artist's work to shine through with as much energy as you would see live.</p>

      <h3>Gary Lebrun | Audio Engineer</h3>
      <p>Gary Lebrun has worked in the music industry his entire life, directing the Coos Bay Lab Band as well as recording countless local and traveling acts.  His ability to craft sound is unmatched on the Oregon coast, and this is made even more impressive by his simplistic approach to equipment.  Many of the sessions in our portfolio are done on a very limited budget, yet he manages to create a sound quality one would expect from a professional studio recording.  Premium sessions allow for him to step up this quality even higher than our typical products.</p>
