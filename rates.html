        <h2>Session Rates</h2>

        <p>One of our focuses at Tidalbridge is creating a platform that encourages growth at all levels, rather than alienate lesser known bands in favor of the most popular acts.  We firmly believe that a united music community is beneficial to everyone.  As such, we have made sure to negate any issues of affordability for our work.  We will work with any budget, even if you can't afford to pay us anything up front, and our baseline expectation for session quality means that even our most limited-budget work can be a crown jewel of your band's press kit.</p>

        <p>The base premise of the Tidalbridge rate system is built around backend profits.  Typically when we record a session, we host the video on our YouTube channel.  If a client pays full price -- $150.00 USD per song -- then they can choose to host it on their own channel instead.  We monetize any sessions held on our channel, and the split of the profits is dependent on how much payment we've received.  In the case of a free session, the artist will receive a 30% cut of all profits we make.  This encourages a mutually beneficial relationship between us and our clients, as even if you're just making the trip out to see us, you are typically guaranteed some sort of financial kickback along with your finished product.</p>
